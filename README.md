# boxwolfi V2

Files for creating a Wolfi base for Distrobox

## Planned rework

Since Distrobox 1.5.0, Wolfi is fully supported. This brought [Jorge Catro] and the [ublue] team to create [bluefin-cli].

The work in this repo is based on `bluefin-cli` and installs specific software for an usage targeted mainly as WSL2.
